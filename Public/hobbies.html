    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy unwinding through various activities that keep me energized and creative:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tech Communities:</strong> I enjoy engaging in student chapters and events, contributing to content and design.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploring New Tech:</strong> I'm constantly experimenting with new tools, frameworks, and ideas in software development.</li>
        <li><strong>Storytelling & Games:</strong> I enjoy building and playing interactive, choice-based games like my Destiny Game app.</li>
    </ul>
